DEVELOPER RESOURCE - COLOUR PALETTE TOOL

https://colour-palette-tool.vercel.app/

Single page tool designed for developers to find, select, and use curated colour themes for their website. Included search function to find by tags, aswell as having each palette divided into it's own filterable categories. Users can take individual hex codes, or copy the CSS / JSON formats to plug the whole palette into their projects.

Great for frontend developers using any frameworks, or anyone insteredted in giving their projects a unifying theme!

(Part of a collection of developer resources I'm working on right now to help out fellow dev's in their first few years of programming. Will be working on an all in one site for these resources soon.)
